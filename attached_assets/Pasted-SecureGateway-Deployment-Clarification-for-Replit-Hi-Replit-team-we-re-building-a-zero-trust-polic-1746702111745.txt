SecureGateway Deployment Clarification for Replit
Hi Replit team — we’re building a zero-trust policy enforcement gateway for LLM agents (project name: SecureGateway). It enforces per-model tool access via JSON-RPC, tracks session behavior, and logs every ToolCall for compliance.

We’re currently running the system in Replit and are preparing to finalize Phase 6, which includes explainable decisions, policy negotiation, and dashboard control.

Can you help confirm or clarify the following infrastructure and runtime details?

⚙️ Runtime & Persistence
What are the current memory and CPU limits for a Repl like this?

Can we reliably keep 500+ active sessions in SESSION_STATE (Python dict)?

What’s the practical file size limit for something like audit.log?

Do files like policies.yaml, audit.log, and trusted_peers.yaml persist across reboots?

We rely on editing YAML configs through the dashboard and reloading them in memory.

Are background jobs supported in Replit?

Can we safely run things like an audit export or log anomaly scanner using threading or asyncio?

🔐 Security & Secrets
Are Replit Secrets secure for production API keys like ADMIN_KEY and MODEL_KEY?

Are they ever exposed to frontend code unintentionally?

Is there a clean way to implement simple admin login/auth flows?

Our dashboard lives at /dash and currently uses X-Admin-Key for access.

🌐 Networking & Federation
Can a Repl make outbound HTTPS requests to peer gateways for federation?

We send ToolCalls between gateways using requests.post() — are there rate or IP restrictions?

Can other nodes reliably call into our Repl-hosted gateway?

Are .repl.co URLs persistent, and can we treat them as federation endpoints?

📦 Deployment, Migration & CI
Can we set up a policy validation check before running main.py?

For example, validate policies.yaml on boot or deploy.

If we need to migrate this Repl to Render or Railway, are our current files portable?

We’re using render.yaml, .replit, .env.example, and Dockerfile.
