# 🧱 MCP-Sec Gateway Architecture

MCP-Sec Gateway is a zero-trust enforcement layer that intercepts Model Context Protocol (MCP) traffic between AI agents and external tools. It validates every tool call, enforces policies, and logs all activity.

## 🔁 Reasoning Loop Flow
```
Prompt → Context Injection → Tool Call → Tool Result → Model Response
```

## 🧩 Deployment Modes
- Sidecar Proxy (in front of MCP server)
- Inline Middleware (embedded in MCP server)
- SaaS Relay (hosted gateway)

## 🛠 Stack
- FastAPI or Node.js (gateway logic)
- Pydantic / ajv (schema validation)
- Open Policy Agent or YAML/JSON policy engine
- Redis for rate limiting
- Structured JSON logging
