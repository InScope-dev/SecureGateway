# MCP-Sec Gateway

A zero-trust security gateway that validates, controls, and logs Model Context Protocol (MCP) traffic between AI models and external tools.

## Overview

MCP-Sec Gateway is a Flask-based middleware that enforces security policies on API requests between AI models and external tools. It includes:

- Policy enforcement based on model ID, tool name, and session
- JSON schema validation for request/response payloads
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring traffic

## Key Components

- **Policy Engine**: Enforces rules defined in YAML configuration files
- **Schema Validator**: Validates request/response payloads against JSON schemas
- **Rate Limiter**: Prevents abuse by limiting calls per session
- **Audit Logger**: Records all activity with risk level assessment
- **Web Dashboard**: Visualizes traffic with color-coded risk levels

### Run in Replit
